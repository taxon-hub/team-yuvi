This project is all about the way to connect with the different people and chat with each other. One can view the other's when he can accept the request and they can connect each other through text messages and this enables to share the content what a person wants and etc.This works absolutely good with bugs reduced and with less memory space which most of them can download easily with less memory space allocated. Messaging apps only work when the people you want to message are on them. Signal is generally the privacy expert's choice for secure comms, but your aunt might not have it. SMS reaches everyone with a phone number but is largely unsecured. iMessage has end-to-end encryption but is only available on Apple devices. WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have massive global reach but also share a common liability: Facebook. Also we have found the similar feature to these social apps with good features which also have privacy in it which have the security in which the one who doesn't know us can't directly message us but through sending the requests once they get accepted they can access. In this app we have an emergency button which can be used during emergency situation.If power button is pressed three times emergency mode will be activated and messages will be sent to given phone numbers. This app can be used for amry people to keep their chat very private.Anoymus infinte chat rooms can be created.This make our privacy more private.
